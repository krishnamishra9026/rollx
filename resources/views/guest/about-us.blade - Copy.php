                        <h1>Our Story</h1>
                        <p>FindMyTradesman.es is Committed to Kicking unfairness out of the Building Trade, which happens to
                            both Customers (Property Owners) and Trade People. We are fast becoming Spain's number 1 online
                            marketplace connecting homeowners with quality local tradespeople. And we are do it on an
                            impressive scale.</p>
                        <p>So far, we now have over 5,600 tradespeople nationwide / Locallyand morejoining daily,that are
                            using our site to grow theirbusiness or just maybe just to fill gaps in their diary, helping
                            them grow their reputation and expand their business. Between them they specialise in more than
                            30 trades.</p>
                        <p>Over 140,000 jobs are posted every year by homeowners wanting to make the most of where they
                            live. Once the work is complete, homeowners leave a review of the tradesperson – and it is this
                            feedback and reviews that gives other homeowners peace of mind that they have found someone
                            reliable.</p>
                        <p>We have been doing this for over 3 years now and the number of reviews you can read about
                            tradespeople is already impressive – and continues to go from strength to strength. Each
                            tradesperson has a profile page where their reviews are listed, and only homeowners who have
                            found their tradesperson through our site are allowed to leave a review. For homeowners, posting
                            a job is free. Our tradespeople pay a subscription fee along with a small cost to quote for each
                            job.</p>

                    <span>5 tips on how to find a good tradesperson We’ve put together some of our top tips explaining how
                        to find a good tradesman that you can rely on: </span>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Use FindMyTradesman.es. to get recommendations Getting recommendations you can rely on is easier
                            than ever online. Want to know how you can get recommendations from hundreds of people who live
                            near you in your local area just a few clicks? By searching for approved and guaranteed
                            tradespeople on FindMyTradesman.es.</li>
                        <li>Request quotes from at least 3 tradespeople with all home improvement projects, we always
                            recommend obtaining at least three quotes from different tradespeople in your area. You’ll want
                            to shop around to make sure you’re paying a fair price for the work. And thankfully, we’ve got a
                            tool that makes finding multiple quotes super easy. Our request a quote feature is perfect for
                            getting quotes: you post details about the work you need doing, and we’ll send it out to local
                            tradespeople in your area. Try it out – it’s quick and easy! Tip: Ask if the price you’re quoted
                            price includes IVA.</li>
                        <li>Make sure they have the relevant qualifications to get the best results, it’s important to hire
                            tradespeople who are dedicated to their trade. Look for a tradesperson with relevant
                            qualifications and accreditations, and check if they’re part of national trade schemes. </li>
                        <li>Choose tradespeople with local experience Hiring a tradesperson with a lot of local experience
                            can be very valuable. They’ll have a working knowledge of local planning permission, have access
                            to a local network of suppliers and alsolabour, and will be local should you need them during
                            the course of your project. </li>
                        <li>Ask for customer references (and contact them) We do this to make sure a tradesperson’s reviews
                            on our website are real, but there’s certainly no harm in you following up on customer
                            references. When you’ve found a tradesperson (or tradespeople) you think could be right for the
                            job, ask them to provide you with references from previous customers about the quality of the
                            tradesperson’s work, what it was like to work with them, and would they hire them again.</li>
